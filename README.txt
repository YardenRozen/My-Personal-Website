About Me:
I’ve always been fascinated by numbers, and working in data analytics has been a long-term goal of mine. My career has taught me to think strategically about problems and identify solutions.

As much as I’m into data manipulation, it’s the analysis of data that really gets me going. I like to explore the relationships between numbers, and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staff. 

I have a B.A. in Business Management Specialization in Finance from The Max Stern Jezreel Valley College with a Certificate of Data Analyst.

Skills: 
* Excel (KPI, Power Pivot, Power Query, Data Structure).
* Database Programming and SQL & Python.
* BI Tools and System Design (Tableau, Power BI).

On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work; . I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I’m comfortable on my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people.

I'm always looking to grow my personal and professional network.
